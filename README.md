# The Bayes Marketing Evaluator #

Designed to divide a marketing e-mail into idea-chunks (chunks of meaning; distinct pieces of information).

Uses a naive Bayes classifier (https://github.com/alexandru/stuff-classifier) to do this.

The goal is to find, over time, the perfect ingredients for a successful marketing e-mail to my target market.


## The Main Menu looks like this: ##
(train) -- TRAIN the program by classifying a message that succeeded or failed
(idea) -- add a message-chunk IDEA to the database
(evaluate) -- EVALUATE a message you're thinking of sending
(quit) -- QUIT the application.
