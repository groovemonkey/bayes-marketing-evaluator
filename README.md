# The Bayes Marketing Evaluator #

Designed to divide a marketing e-mail into idea-chunks (chunks of meaning; distinct pieces of information).

Uses a naive Bayes classifier (https://github.com/alexandru/stuff-classifier) to do this.

The goal is to find, over time, the perfect ingredients for a successful marketing e-mail to my target market.
